Tone: Formal, concise, and professional. Use neutral language appropriate for reporting to an external managing organization.
Structure: Start with a one-line statement of objective, then a 2-3 sentence summary of the outcome, followed by key evidence/metrics and concluding with the next steps or recommendations if any.
Focus: Be explicit about what was achieved and avoid speculative or unverified claims. Keep the final text clear for non-technical managers.
Length: Aim for about 180-220 words if possible, but shorter is acceptable if information is incomplete.
